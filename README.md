# Galleria

<i><b>Galleria</b></i> is social media application project where users could post images and texts to share with other people that have an account on the application. The application also has followers and following where it limits the posts that the users will see on their feed.

This project was written from scratch using <i><b>[Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)</b></i>, <i><b>[ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/)</b></i>, <i><b>[Redux](https://redux.js.org/)</b></i>, <i><b>[SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/)</b></i> and other libraries. Typescript was chosen as the primary language for the project as it is a typed version of javascript which allows the developers to write reliable and robust code. As I am an aspiring NodeJS and ReactJS developer, I used ReactJS to build this application alongside with Redux to manage states of the application. The purpose of this project is to enhance and improve my skills and understanding with regards to ReactJS and Redux.

<i><b>Note:</b></i> I'm building this project with my colleague during our capstone project as he also wanted to learn ReactJS.

## Installation

- Be sure to have the latest LTS version of <i><b>[NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)</b></i> installed.

- On this project, I used <i><b>[Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)</b></i> as package manager.

```bash
# To install yarn globally
npm install -g yarn
```

- Clone this project repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dwrdvncntcvs/galleria-client.git
```

- The application relies on environment variables which means you should create a <b><i>.env</i></b> file and store the following variables:

```dotenv
ADD API BASE_URL
REACT_APP_GALLERIA_API_URL= <URL of Galleria API that I created>
```

- Run these commands.

```bash

# To install all the dependencies used in this project
yarn

# To run the application
yarn start

# To build the application
yarn build

# To test the application
yarn test

# To eject the application

```
